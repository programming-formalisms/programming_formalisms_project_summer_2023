## `acorbat`

https://github.com/acorbat/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/5b85cea021091d6803a422af89ce8c57d262953c

1 cycle, worked on `develop`

Fine first step, needed more time. You will get that tomorrow :-)

## `bszeitz` and `Roman-SI`

https://github.com/bszeitz/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/d747f37725249cab9c999bd372d260e08807f374

3 commits, worked on `develop`

About First commit at https://github.com/bszeitz/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/f4ace2eaf4c935ee1171b9f1e8b00f19be4d2f2f :
this is a quite of a shortcut, by writing the full `is_prime` function first.
This causes the next two commits to be weaker.
Try writing the test first next time.

The second commit at https://github.com/bszeitz/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/36e223287f938f249875118b114db54449b83aed :
a `print` statement is put in, instead of an exception. 
Use exceptions for ... uh ... exceptions :-)
Also, there is no test for this (and one cannot test that, AFAIK).

The third commit at https://github.com/bszeitz/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/d747f37725249cab9c999bd372d260e08807f374 :
nice to see some tests, but would you agree with those? I copy-paste them here for you:

```
assert is_prime(4)
assert is_prime(1)
assert is_prime("dsgdfshfjz")
assert is_prime(4.567)
```

In summary: next time, try to be more strict in the TDD

## `hahohe1982`

https://github.com/hahohe1892/programming_formalisms_testing/tree/dev

Worked on `dev` branch (which is a fine name!)

1 unfinished cycle with 3 tests.

Do 1 test at a time, like TDD recommends.

## `miclko`

https://github.com/miclko/programming_formalisms_testing

No commit, so time was too short. No worries, you'll have more time tomorrow :-)

## `RenateWilcke` and `semccomas` and `acorbat`

https://github.com/RenateWilcke/programming_formalisms_testing/commits/master

Worked on `master` branch

First commit by acorbat: https://github.com/RenateWilcke/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/d804f4126dca053afc9568de44c45b03ce65fb0b :
beautiful, minimal commit with a test

Second commit by acorbat: https://github.com/RenateWilcke/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/8c1d46da7ecec540b8b3ad6b2dae27b483b57ed1
does not solve the test yet, I guess time was up for the driver :-)

Third commit by `RenateWilcke`: https://github.com/RenateWilcke/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/dabe5d623ea71ff279c0ccc4008e3e5d261151c5
Beautiful doc added!

Fourth commit by semccomas: https://github.com/RenateWilcke/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/62c92b2b4700fe4842ba1ba296689e6d96b41128
Yup, that is a good next step!


## `Roman-Si`

Worked on `develop`: well done!

First commit, by dianaiusan at https://github.com/Roman-Si/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/fbecaa6f631fc5d446d0b143c1b747b66786d088
Write the test first, this is TDD. The function is undocumented, 
nor does it check its input type.

Second commit, by dianaiusan at https://github.com/Roman-Si/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/c768af1a76d828a120613d683f838c90a392d910
No need for a speed improvement, write a test that fails first.

## `semccomas`

https://github.com/semccomas/programming_formalisms_testing/tree/develop

Worked on `develop` and `new_develop`: I enjoy the inventiveness of this!

On develop, first commit: https://github.com/semccomas/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/1df31bb3d8615c72cc4677c47384a7e3ce598f87
Hey, those are two tests, you go too fast! Write one test at a time, in true TDD fashion.
Also, make the a test pass before you go to the next one.

Second commit by `DanielRiepl`: https://github.com/semccomas/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/f5620ab8fe6b2aa6945006e324a13b7658c1d9a7
Hey, those are three tests, you go too fast! Write one test at a time, in true TDD fashion.

## `TinclG`

https://github.com/TinclG/programming_formalisms_testing

Worked on `master`: try to work on `develop` (or your own branch) next time.

The commit at https://github.com/TinclG/programming_formalisms_testing/commit/4248f166d5aa09943910d74903545e15244bf6fd
is empty. It's OK, there was little time: you will get that tomorrow :-)
