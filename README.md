 * [1] Branches are ordered: `master`, `develop`, then name of the feature branches alphabetically

The project of [the UPPMAX 'Programming Formalisms' course](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms)
in 2023.

## Goal

 * Develop code together in a formal/structured way
 * Get experience with best practices
 * Maybe bonus: use the code developed for your own work

## Workflow

 * Always work in a project, create a Project if needed.
   The first Issue for a Project is to document what it needs to do.
 * Within a project, always work on one Issue: 
   assign yourself and move to 'In Progress' on the kanban board
 * Each problem start with a design that is reviewed:
   when an Issue is posted for review, move the Issue to 'Under review'
 * Each reviewed design is implemented using TDD, after which the code is reviewed:
   when an Issue is posted for review, move the Issue to 'Under review'
 * Always work in pairs. Switch roles using either time, or Ping-Pong technique
 * Branching model from [Vincent Driessen's post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
   (see also this video: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/pM520_JLR6w) [download (.ogv)](https://richelbilderbeek.nl/git_work_on_feature_branch_pull_request_to_develop.ogv))
   * `master` always works
   * `develop` is where merging takes place. 
     Merging to `develop` is done by a Pull Request with a code review,
     that follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   * Feature branches are where Issues are fixed

 * Use of TDD
 * Use of CI: tests, codecov, ruff
 * 100% code coverage
 * `ruff` style guide

## Newbie Issues

 1. [Join the team](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/1)
 2. [Create a branch with your name](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/4)
 3. [Add your personal branch to README.md](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/4)
 4. Pick and solve an early Euler problem:
   * [1](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/6)
   * [2](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/7)
   * [3](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/8)
   * [4](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/9)
   * [5](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/10)
   * [6](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/11)
   * [7](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/12)
   * [8](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/13)
   * [9](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/14)
   * [10](https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_project_2023/issues/15)

In all cases:

 * Assign yourself to the Issue if you work on it: only then it is yours
 * Put the Issue to 'In Progress' while you work on it
 * Put the Issue to 'In review' after doing the Pull Request to `develop`

## Junior Issues

Here you are more free.

Pick your favorite among:

 * Refactor a solved Euler project solution
 * Improve the speed of a solved Euler project solution
 * Solve a harder Euler project problem
 * Solve a custom problem: create a simple design document first

In all cases:

 * Create an Issue for it
